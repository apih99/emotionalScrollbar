# 🎭 Emotional Scrollbar

A creative and interactive web experience where scrolling controls the emotions of a cartoon face instead of moving page content. Perfect for TikTok-style engaging content!

## ✨ Features

- **Emotional Face Animation**: SVG cartoon face with smooth transitions between emotions
- **Scroll-Based Control**: Scrolling percentage directly controls facial expressions
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Background colors change based on emotions
- **Particle Effects**: Animated particles that respond to emotion intensity
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and SVG animations for fluid experience

## 🎨 How It Works

- **Scroll to Top (0-30%)**: The face becomes increasingly happy, with sparkles and golden colors
- **Middle Range (30-70%)**: The face maintains a neutral expression with colorful backgrounds
- **Scroll to Bottom (70-100%)**: The face becomes sad, with tears and blue tones
